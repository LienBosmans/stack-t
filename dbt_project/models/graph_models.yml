  - name: event_nodes
    description: Nodes that correspond to all unique events in the dataset.
    columns:
      - name: event_id
        description: The event id is used as the primary key (PK)
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
          - relationships:

      - name: event_description
        description: Description of this event.
      - name: event_type
        description: Descriptive name of this event's type.
      - name: event_timestamp
        description: Timestamp of this event.
  
  - name: object_snapshots
    description: From a certain object, an object snapshot is created for every relevant timestamp. Relevant timestamps are timestamps of events to which the object is linked (event to object relationship) and timestamps when object attributes were updated.
    columns:
      - name: object_snapshot_id
        description: The object id and timestamp are combined to generate a new primary key (PK).
        tests:

      - name: object_description
        description: Description of the linked object.
      - name: object_type
        description: Descriptive name of the linked object's type.

  - name: event_flow
    description: Edges that describe the event flow from object's perspective. Includes 'event' -> 'object snapshot', 'object snapshot' -> 'next object snapshot' (in case of attribute updates not linked to event timestamps), and 'object snapshot' -> 'next event'.
    columns:
      - name: start_id
        description: Foreign key (FK) of 'from', should be PK of either an event node or an object snapshot node.

      - name: relation
        description: Describes the relation between the 'from' and 'to' node.
      - name: object_description
        description: Description of the linked object.
      - name: label
        description: Descriptive label that can be used to describe the ege. Created by combining the relation and the object description.
      - name: type
        description: Describes the type of the edge. 'EVENT_TO_OBJECT' is used for 'event' -> 'object snapshot'. 'NEXT_EVENT' is used for 'object snapshot' -> 'next event'. 'OBJECT_ATTRIBUTE_UPDATE' is used for 'object snapshot' -> 'next object snapshot' (in case of attribute updates not linked to event timestamps)
        tests:
          - not_null
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['EVENT_TO_OBJECT','NEXT_EVENT','OBJECT_ATTRIBUTE_UPDATE']


  - name: object_relations
    description: Edges that describe the object-to-object relationships between object snapshot nodes. Note that the object-to-object relation is added between object_snapshots that share the same timestamp.
    columns:
      - name: start_id
        description: Foreign key (FK) of 'from', should be PK of an object snapshot node.
